This mod is about building nuclear reactors, rockets, nukes, weapons and bunkers.<br>
It is based on the awesome work of Alcater, Drillgon and HBM.<br>
It features an expansive tech tree of various processing and utility machines, craftable bombs and missiles, guns, and abandoned structures to explore.<br>
Due to the amount and complexity of the recipes of this mod, JEI is strongly recommended.<br>

No longer are nukes just green TNT blocks - you will have to synthesize new types of explosives and enrich uranium before you can send nuclear missiles towards your pals.<br>

This is the edited version of Alcater's custom version of HBM's NTM mod (version 2.0.2).<br>
The latest version can be found on Curseforge, and on Github, but you have to build it though.<br>
The licence for this project can be found in the LICENSE.MD file.<br>
