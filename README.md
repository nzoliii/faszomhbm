This mod is about building nuclear reactors, rockets, nukes, weapons and bunkers.<br>
It is based on the awesome work of Drillgon and HBM.<br>
Due to the amount and complexity of the recipes of this mod, JEI (Just Enough Items) is strongly recommended.<br>
This mod is based on Alcater's NTM Extended Edition mod (version 2.0.2).<br>
It aims to add no useful features, only memes and funny things.<br>

<h1>Features</h1>
This mod is, as the name implies, all about technology, atomic science and nuclear weapons. It features an expansive<br>
tech tree of various processing and utility machines, craftable bombs and missiles, guns, and abandoned structures to<br>
explore. Nukes are no longer just green TNT blocks - you will have to synthesize new types of explosives and enrich<br>
uranium before you can send nuclear missiles towards your pals.<br>
